Succinct data structures for collections.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>This package provides implementations of some succinct techniques for the storage of static lists. The main ingredient is the 
Elias&ndash;Fano representation of monotone sequences. For monotone sequences, such as file pointers,
an {@link it.unimi.dsi.sux4j.util.EliasFanoMonotoneLongBigList} is the obvious choice. For general
sequences, you can either use an {@link it.unimi.dsi.sux4j.util.EliasFanoPrefixSumLongBigList},
which stores the sequence using its prefix sums, or an
{@link it.unimi.dsi.sux4j.util.EliasFanoLongBigList}. The former is faster and provides also
prefix sums, but the latter provides a better compression ratio if the values stored are skewed
towards small values.
